# Swift Architecture Examples
Project focused on having a bunch of sample apps implementing different mobile architectures for native Development.

## Plans

Implementend Architetures:

- MVVM(SwiftUI)
- MVVM-C(UIKit)

<br>
Planned architectures:
- MVC (UIKit)
- VIPER (UIKit)
- VIP (UIKit)
- Redux
- Flux

<br>
Won't be added:

- MVVM-C (SwiftUI) reason is while I studied this, it seems convoluted and more like a problem searching for a solution. In UIKit is totally reasonable.
