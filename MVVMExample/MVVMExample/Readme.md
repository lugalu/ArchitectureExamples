# MVVM

This is an offline mvvm example, not all "buttons" lead somewhere. The layout is a copy of a brazilian app focused on Blood donations.

The Overview and the FAQ are the only views available because I don't want to copy an entire product and let the design be easily stolen.

## Features
Currently:

- Service locator
- Some Level of Dependency injection 
- a Screen that changes based on the mocked Data.
